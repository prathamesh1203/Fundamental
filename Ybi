Hereâ€™s a Python project that follows your required structure:

---

### **Title of Project:**  
**Predicting Student Performance Based on Study Hours**

---

### **Objective:**  
To predict the scores of students based on the number of hours they studied using a simple linear regression model.

---

### **Data Source:**  
The dataset is a simple CSV file containing two columns:  
1. **Hours:** Number of hours studied  
2. **Scores:** Percentage scores obtained by the student  

The dataset can be downloaded or created manually.

---

### **Import Library:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
```

---

### **Import Data:**
```python
# Load the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/HoursScores.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)
```

---

### **Describe Data:**
```python
# View first few rows
print(data.head())

# Summary statistics
print(data.describe())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())
```

---

### **Data Visualization:**
```python
# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(data['Hours'], data['Scores'], color='blue')
plt.title('Study Hours vs Scores')
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
plt.ylabel('Percentage Score')
plt.show()

# Correlation heatmap
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
```

---

### **Data Preprocessing:**
```python
# No missing values or outliers, so no preprocessing is required here.
# If needed, we could scale or normalize data.
```

---

### **Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):**
```python
# Define features and target variable
X = data[['Hours']]
y = data['Scores']
```

---

### **Train Test Split:**
```python
# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

---

### **Modeling:**
```python
# Initialize and train the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### **Model Evaluation:**
```python
# Predict on test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation metrics
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
```

---

### **Prediction:**
```python
# Predict score for a student who studies 9.25 hours
hours = np.array([[9.25]])
predicted_score = model.predict(hours)
print(f"Predicted Score for 9.25 hours of study: {predicted_score[0]:.2f}")
```

---

### **Explanation:**
This project demonstrates the use of **Simple Linear Regression** to predict student scores based on their study hours.  
1. **Correlation:** A positive correlation exists between study hours and scores.  
2. **Model:** The linear regression model fit the data well, as evidenced by a high R-squared value.  
3. **Predictions:** The model can predict scores for new input values, making it a practical tool for educators and students.
